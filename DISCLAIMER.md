GridDown is **NOT** a substitute for:

- ❌ Professional search and rescue (SAR) services
- ❌ Official emergency response systems (911, 112, etc.)
- ❌ Licensed medical professionals and emergency medical services
- ❌ Certified navigation equipment (GPS receivers, aviation instruments)
- ❌ Professional weather forecasting services
- ❌ Proper wilderness survival training
- ❌ Licensed radio operators (where required)

### Supplementary Tool Only

GridDown should be used as **one tool among many** in your preparedness toolkit. Always:

- ✅ Carry redundant navigation methods (paper maps, compass, backup GPS)
- ✅ Inform others of your plans before venturing into remote areas
- ✅ Carry appropriate emergency communication devices
- ✅ Obtain proper training for wilderness activities
- ✅ Check official weather forecasts from authoritative sources
- ✅ Follow local regulations and obtain required permits

## Navigation & Position Disclaimer

### GPS and Location Accuracy

- GPS positions displayed in GridDown are provided by your device's GPS receiver
- Accuracy varies based on satellite visibility, terrain, and device quality
- **Do not rely solely on GPS** - it can fail due to battery depletion, signal obstruction, or device malfunction
- Urban canyons, dense forest, and mountainous terrain can degrade GPS accuracy
- Always carry paper maps and a magnetic compass as backup

### Offline Maps

- Offline map tiles are cached copies that may become outdated
- Trail conditions, road closures, and land use can change after maps are downloaded
- Verify current conditions through official sources before travel
- Some map layers may have incomplete coverage in certain regions

### Celestial Navigation

- Celestial navigation features are educational aids and require proper training
- Accuracy depends on correct time, observer skill, and atmospheric conditions
- **Do not rely on celestial navigation without formal training**
- Always maintain backup navigation methods

### Dead Reckoning / Inertial Navigation

- Smartphone sensor-based navigation accumulates errors over time
- Accuracy degrades significantly over distances greater than 1-2 km
- Use only as a temporary measure when other navigation is unavailable
- Recalibrate frequently when GPS becomes available
